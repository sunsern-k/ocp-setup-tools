# Install OpenShift Container Storage Operator from UI: 
# Reference: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/4.8
# For VMware - use the dynamic "thin" storageclass as the PVs for each ODF node

Procedure
- Log in to OpenShift Web Console.
- Click Operators -> OperatorHub.
- Search for "OpenShift Container Storage" from the list of operators and click on it.
- Click Install.
- Set the following options on the Install Operator page:
  - Channel as stable-4.8.
  - Installation Mode as A specific namespace on the cluster.
  - Installed Namespace as Operator recommended namespace openshift-storage. If Namespace openshift-storage does not exist, it will be created during the operator installation.
  - Approval Strategy as Automatic or Manual.
  - Click Install.

NOTE:
- If you select Automatic updates, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your operator without any intervention.
- If you select Manual updates, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the operator updated to the new version.
