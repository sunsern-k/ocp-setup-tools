# The rhcos comes with VMWare Hardware version 13, so it is required to upgrade to the latest
# Otherwise it will show a Warning below after the cluster installation and it won't be convenient
# to shutdown each VM and upgrade the hardware version.
#
# The cluster is using VMs with hardware version lower than 15, which is being deprecated by
# Openshift. Hardware version 15 or greater is required by vSphere CSI driver. Please update your
# VMs t o at least HW version 15.

# Covert a template to be a vm and it can be upgraded by:
# govc vm.upgrade -vm /$vcenterdatacenter/vm/$clustername/<template-vm-name>
